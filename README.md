# gfifinder

gfifinder (aka Good First Issue Finder) is a package to find issues that are labelled as "good first issue" and other filters defined in `git.go` for the top 300 companies as defined in https://gitstar-ranking.com/organizations

# TODO/ next-in-line
1. make some filter criteria configurable via command line arguments
2. handle pagination in github api calls
